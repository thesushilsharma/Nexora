# Nexora
This project is a Next.js and TypeScript based real estate product listing page that allows users to filter properties by price, number of bedrooms, and order them by price (ascending/descending), most recent, or alphabetically. Each property has an image, address, size, number of bedrooms, price, and the time it was added to the database. Users can click on any property image to view more details about the property.

## Features
